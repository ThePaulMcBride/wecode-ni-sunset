# WeCode NI Sunset

I've taken the decision to sunset WeCode NI. It's been a great journey and I've met some amazing people along the way. I've learned a lot and I'm grateful for the experience. This repo contains the website that will be used for the announcement.

I've written a little about how and why I think this had to happen. [Sunsetting WeCode NI](https://paulmcbride.com/posts/sunsetting-wecode-ni)
